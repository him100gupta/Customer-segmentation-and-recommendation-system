## Model Evaluation and Recommendations: 
The goal of this customer segmentation analysis was to identify distinct groups within the customer base of an online retail company. By examining various customer attributes such as Recency, Frequency, Monetary value, Average Order Value, and behavioral metrics, we aimed to understand different customer segments and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.
The analysis revealed four unique customer clusters, each with distinct characteristics and behaviors.
