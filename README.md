## Overview
This project focuses on segmenting customers of an online retail store based on their purchase history. The objective is to identify distinct customer groups to provide personalized recommendations and targeted marketing strategies. The process includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction using PCA, and clustering using hierarchical clustering and K-means. The results are analyzed and visualized to name and understand the characteristics of each cluster.

## Libraries Used
+ Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
+ NumPy: Numerical computations.
+ Matplotlib: Data visualization.
+ Seaborn: Statistical data visualization.
+ Scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms and tools.
+ Scipy: Scientific computations and hierarchical clustering.

## Approach
1. Data Preprocessing: - Extracting meaningful data.
2. Feature Engineering: - Creation of new features such as Recency, Frequency, Monetary, etc.
3. Dimensionality Reduction: - Applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining most of the variance.
4. Clustering: - Using K-means clustering to segment the customers based on the reduced dimensions from PCA.
5. Cluster Analysis: - Analyzing and naming clusters based on EDA to derive meaningful insights and business value from the segmented groups.

## Conclusion
The project successfully segments customers into meaningful clusters, providing a foundation for personalized marketing strategies and improving customer relationship management. The insights gained from the analysis help in understanding customer behavior and preferences, leading to better decision-making and enhanced customer satisfaction.
